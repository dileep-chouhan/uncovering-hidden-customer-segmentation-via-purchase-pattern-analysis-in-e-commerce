# Uncovering Hidden Customer Segmentation via Purchase Pattern Analysis in E-commerce

**Overview:**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchase behavior.  The analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns and insights that can inform targeted marketing strategies, leading to improved sales conversion rates and enhanced customer engagement.  The project utilizes data manipulation, visualization, and statistical techniques to segment customers and understand their purchasing characteristics.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add any other libraries used here]


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings and statistical summaries of the customer segmentation analysis to the console.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segment_distribution.png`, `average_purchase_value.png`, etc.) which provide a visual representation of the identified customer segments and their purchasing patterns.  These plots are saved in the project's output directory.  The specific visualizations will depend on the dataset and the analysis performed.


**Data:**

[Optional: Add information about the data used, source, and any preprocessing steps performed.  Example:  "The data used in this project is a synthetic dataset generated to mimic real-world e-commerce transaction data.  The dataset includes information on customer IDs, purchase dates, product categories, and purchase amounts.  Data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and outlier detection, were performed before analysis."]
